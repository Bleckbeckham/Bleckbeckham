Versioning in Software Development:
===================================
Version control systems:
  Local 
  Centralised 
  Distributed
     Git 


Fintech Customers/clients : 
   visa/paypal/mastercard/ae 

Version Control systems:
  - Local [using your own computer/system]
       Developers write and save codes in their local-Computers 
  - Centralised
  - Distributed
Git and GitHub
==============
GIT: DVCs 
  Distributed Version Control system 
  - Git manage data as snapshots.
  - It takes a picture of what all your files look like 
     at that moment and stores 
    a reference to that snapshot.
  Benefits: Nearly every operation is local
            git has data intergrity
            Git generally only adds data

SCM = Source Code management
=======================-====  

other DVCs:
SVN --> Sub Version
CVS --> Concurrent Version system
TFS --> Team Foundation Server
Git --> 95% plus of companies are using GIT   

Git --> Distributed Version Control systems. DVCS
Source Code Management = SCM:
        GitHub - MS
        GitLab
        BitBucket (Stash) - A
